# HSA Songbook Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 29, 2025**

This privacy policy explains what information HSA Songbook (hsasongbook.com) collects, how we use it, and what choices you have. We've tried to keep this simple and readable.

**Important:** This website is an independent passion project. It is not officially endorsed by, affiliated with, or sponsored by any church organization.

---

## The Short Version

- We collect only what we need (your email and username)
- We don't sell your data to anyone
- We don't use analytics or tracking tools
- We only email you for account stuff (password resets) or major policy updates
- You can delete your account anytime

---

## 1. Information We Collect

### Information you provide directly:

**When you create an account:**
- Email address (required)
- Username (required)

**In the future, we may allow you to optionally add:**
- Display name
- Profile picture
- Bio
- Church location
- Social media links

You're never required to provide optional information. Your account works fine without it.

**When you use the site:**
- Songs, arrangements, and lyrics you upload
- Setlists you create
- Favorites you mark
- Groups you join or create

### Information collected automatically:

**Session cookies:** When you log in, we store a small piece of data in your browser to keep you logged in. This is a "session cookie." It's deleted when you log out or after a period of inactivity. We don't use cookies for tracking or advertising.

**That's it.** We don't use Google Analytics or any other analytics tools. We're not tracking your behavior around the site.

---

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use your information to:

- Create and manage your account
- Let you log in
- Display your username on content you upload (so others know who contributed it)
- Send you password reset emails when you request them
- Notify you of significant changes to our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy
- Respond if you contact us

**We do NOT:**
- Sell your information to anyone
- Send marketing emails or newsletters
- Share your email address publicly (only your username is visible to other users)
- Track your browsing behavior
- Build advertising profiles

## 3. Third-Party Services

We use a few services to run this site. Here's who they are and what they can access:

| Service | What they do | What they can access |
|---------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Vercel** | Hosts the website | Server logs (IP addresses, page requests) |
| **Resend** | Sends emails (password resets, etc.) | Your email address when we send you something |
| **Ko-fi** | Donation platform (external link) | Nothing from us — if you donate, that's between you and Ko-fi |

Each of these services has their own privacy policy. We encourage you to review them if you're curious:
- Vercel: https://vercel.com/legal/privacy-policy
- Resend: https://resend.com/legal/privacy-policy
- Ko-fi: https://ko-fi.com/home/privacy

## 4. Where Your Data Lives

Our site is hosted on Vercel's servers in the United States. By using HSA Songbook, you consent to your data being transferred to and stored in the US.

---

## 5. Data Retention

**Account information:** We keep your email and username for as long as you have an account.

**Content you upload:** Songs, arrangements, and setlists remain on the site until you delete them or delete your account (see below).

**Emails:** We don't retain copies of transactional emails (like password resets) beyond what's necessary to send them.

## 6. Your Choices & Rights

### Access your data
You can view your account information, uploaded content, and setlists anytime by logging into your account.

### Update your data
You can update your email, username, or any optional profile information through your account settings.

### Delete your data
You can delete individual songs, arrangements, or setlists at any time.

### Delete your account
You can delete your entire account at any time. When you do, you'll have two options:

**Option A: Delete my account but keep my contributions**
- Your account is deleted
- Your uploaded content remains on the site
- Your contributions will be attributed to "Deleted User" or shown without a linked profile
- This helps preserve the community resource

**Option B: Delete my account and all my content**
- Your account is deleted
- All songs and arrangements you uploaded are deleted
- All setlists you created are deleted

**Please note:** Even with Option B, the following may remain:
- Contributions you made to "Community" group songs (these are collaborative by nature)
- Duplicated arrangements that others created based on your work (these belong to the users who created them, though links back to your original will be removed)

### Data portability
If you want a copy of your data, contact us and we'll provide what we have.

## 7. Children's Privacy

HSA Songbook is intended for worship leaders and musicians who are at least 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has created an account, please contact us and we will delete it.

## 8. Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your information:

- Passwords are hashed (we can't see them)
- We use HTTPS encryption
- We limit access to user data

That said, no website is 100% secure. Please use a strong, unique password for your account.

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. When we do:

- We'll update the "Last Updated" date at the top
- For significant changes, we'll notify you via email
