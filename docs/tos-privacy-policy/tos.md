Welcome to HSA Songbook (hsasongbook.com). This is a community resource for sharing worship songs, chord charts, and arrangements within the Unificationist community. By using this site, you agree to these terms.

## 2. Who Can Use This Site

- You must be at least 13 years old to create an account
- You need a valid email address to register
- Anyone can view public content without an account
- You need an account to upload songs, create arrangements, make setlists, or favorite content

---

## 3. Your Account

- You're responsible for keeping your login information secure
- You're responsible for all activity under your account
- Use your real name or a recognizable username—this is a community, not an anonymous forum
- One account per person, please

---

## 4. What You Can Upload

**You may upload:**

- Original songs and arrangements you created
- Traditional hymns and songs in the public domain (generally 70+ years old)
- Content you have explicit permission to share
- Your own arrangements of songs, with proper attribution to the original

**You may NOT upload:**

- Copyrighted songs without permission from the copyright holder
- Content that isn't yours while claiming it is
- Anything illegal, harmful, hateful, or inappropriate
- Spam or advertisements

---

## 5. When You Upload Content

By uploading content to HSA Songbook, you agree that:

1. **You have the right to share it.** Either you created it, it's in the public domain, or you have permission from whoever owns it.

2. **You're granting other users permission to use it for worship.** This means other users can view your content, use it in their church services, print it out for their worship team, and include it in their setlists.

3. **You're NOT giving away ownership.** You still own your original work. You're just letting the community use it for worship purposes.

4. **Others cannot republish your work elsewhere or claim it as their own.** Using it at church is fine. Uploading it to another website or publishing it in a songbook without your permission is not.

5. **You allow others to duplicate and modify your arrangements.** If someone loves your arrangement but wants to tweak a few chords for their setting, that's allowed. Duplicated arrangements will link back to your original.

---

## 6. The "Community" Group

Some traditional songs have unknown origins or have been passed down through generations with no clear author. The "Community" group exists for these songs. Content in the Community group:

- Can be edited and improved by any registered user
- Has no single owner
- Should include source information when known
- Is meant to preserve and document our shared musical heritage

---

## 7. Copyright & DMCA

**We respect copyright.** We also expect you to.

If you believe something on this site infringes your copyright, please contact us with:

- Your contact information
- A description of the copyrighted work
- The URL of the infringing content on our site
- A statement that you believe in good faith the use is not authorized
- A statement that your information is accurate and you are the copyright owner (or authorized to act on their behalf)

Send copyright notices to: contact@hsasongbook.com

**What happens when we receive a valid notice:**

- We will remove or disable access to the content
- We will notify the user who uploaded it
- Repeat offenders will have their accounts terminated

**We are a platform, not a publisher.** We don't review every upload before it goes live. We rely on our community to act in good faith and will respond promptly to valid copyright concerns.

---

## 8. What We Can Do

We reserve the right to:

- Remove any content for any reason, with or without notice
- Suspend or terminate any account that violates these terms
- Modify or discontinue the site at any time
- Update these terms (we'll notify users of significant changes)

We don't have to, but we may monitor content and enforce these terms at our discretion.

---

## 9. What We Don't Do

- **We don't guarantee the site will always be available.** This is a passion project, not a commercial service.
- **We don't verify the accuracy of uploaded content.** If someone posts wrong chords, that's on them.
- **We don't provide legal advice.** If you're unsure whether you can upload something, consult a lawyer or err on the side of caution.
- **We don't endorse user content.** Just because something is on the site doesn't mean we agree with it or verify its quality.

---

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

- HSA Songbook is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind
- We are not liable for any damages arising from your use of the site
- We are not liable for content uploaded by users
- We are not liable for copyright infringement by users

**In plain English:** This is a free community resource run by a volunteer. If something goes wrong, we'll do our best to fix it, but we can't be held legally responsible for everything that happens on a platform with user-generated content.

---

## 11. Disputes

- These terms are governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota, USA
- Any disputes will be resolved in the courts of Minnesota
- You agree to attempt informal resolution before filing any legal action

---

## 12. Changes to These Terms

We may update these terms from time to time. When we do:
